All of the content here is dedicated to making me better at math. And when I say better I mean as best as possible, knowing every detail of almost everything.

I don't care of being beginner friendly and maybe it'll be so much formal to everyone else.

#### References

I'll use a pattern of books in each subject:

- **A formal**, that'll explain things like they are constructed, using *formal logic* and *maybe non intuitive thinking*.

- **An intuitive**, that's *simple to understand* but has a *lot of holes in the theory*.

- **A summary like**, a good book but too large to read from end to end, so that'll be the *main guide to what to learn*.

- **A history one**, that contains *context and history about the subject*, making it more deep. 

And some other extra small books or articles can be added, maybe some chapters from a book too. I'll list all references for each subject.

#### Goals

As I said before, my main goal with this study is to become good at math, but this'll be no easy and will be a long journey.

As a **first short goal**, I want to be capable of *understand, do exercises and use freely* the following books:

- [The Art Of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming), by Donald Knuth
- Walter Rudin books:
	- [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Mathematical_Analysis) (Baby Rudin or PMA)
	- [Real and Complex Analysis](https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Real_and_Complex_Analysis.html?id=Z_fuAAAAMAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) (Papa Rudin)
	- [Functional Analysis](https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Functional_Analysis.html?id=ehzvAAAAMAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) (Grandpa Rudin)
- [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics)
- [Curso de Física Básica](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Curso+de+F%C3%ADsica+B%C3%A1sica#ip=1), by Moysés Nussenzveig

Sometimes I'll use this books as references too, but they are my main goal and want to read from end to end.

#### Roadmap

As math is non-linear, all content here isn't either. All is related with all else, and there'll be no right path, but needed subjects will be referenced in each subject. 

[[Basic Logic]] -> [[Basic Set Theory]]

Obs: The roadmap is not complete, and probably will never be, and will be continuously updated.
